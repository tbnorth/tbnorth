GitHub user pages must be published from
[`master`](https://github.com/tbnorth/tbnorth.github.io/tree/master), so `master` is a throw away
branch where `push -f` is ok, and
[`devel`](https://github.com/tbnorth/tbnorth.github.io/tree/devel) is the real `master`.  `push -f` OK
because https://tbnorth.github.io/ may include BLOBs which don't need version
control.
